Easily switch between projects

    $ pj [OPTION] [PATTERN]

[PATTERN]

    Without a preceding [OPTION] pj will use [PATTERN] to 
    determine the project to switch to using a regex search
    on the available project names. It will fail if there
    is more than one match or if there are no matches.

    Tab completion is available.

    If neither [OPTIONS] or [PATTERN] are provided then
    pj will open fzf for you to select a project interactively.
